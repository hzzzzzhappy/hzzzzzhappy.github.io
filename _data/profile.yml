<p>Since September 2023, I have been enrolled at Shenzhen University’s School of Financial Technology & Futures and the Shenzhen-Nantes Financial Technology Institute in France, pursuing a B.S. in Management (Information Management & Information Systems) and a B.S. in Blockchain Information Systems, respectively.
From May 2024, I have continued my studies at the Shenzhen University Computer Vision Institute under the guidance of Dr. Can Gao and Dr. Jinbao Wang.
Starting March 2025, I joined the Eastern Institute of Technology as a research assistant in an internship program led by Dr. Xin Jin and Dr. Wenjun Zeng.
In September 2025, I will begin an internship at the Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, advised by Dr. Aoran Wang and Dr. Shixiang Tang.
My research focuses on 2D/3D anomaly detection and Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, and I am now transitioning toward causal inference within AI4Sci.
